# Introduction
This MicroROS-Pi5 ROS2 car is developed based on Raspberry Pi 5. It consists of a Micro ROS robot expansion board with ESP32 co-processor, 4PCS 370 encoder motor, high-quality tires, 7.4V 2000mAh rechargeable battery, MS200 lidar, 2MP camera, 2DOF gimbal and an aluminum alloy frame. It adopt ROS2-HUMBLE development environment and Python3 programming, and uses OpenCV image processing and MediaPipe machine learning algorithms to achieve multiple functions such as robot motion control, AI visual interaction, SLAM mapping navigation, RViz simulation and multi-machine synchronization control. Users can control it by mobile APP, wireless controller, computer keyboard control. Yahboom will provide each customer with detailed tutorial materials, installation videos and professional technical support.
